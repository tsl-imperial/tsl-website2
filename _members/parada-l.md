Leandro Parada has been a PhD student at the Centre for Transport Studies (CTS) since 2020 and is a member of the Transport Systems and Logistics Laboratory. His research interests lie in developing advanced algorithms for autonomous vehicles to operate safely and efficiently in complex urban environments, with a focus on promoting collaboration and coordination between agents using novel methods that combine Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) and Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) networks.

Leandro holds a Mechanical Engineering degree and an MSc in Industrial Engineering, both from Universidad de Concepción. After completing his studies, he worked as a Management Consultant for four years, developing and implementing Decision Support Systems for industries such as Logistics, Healthcare, and Energy.
