abstract = {The increasing level of congestion and infrastructure costs in cities have created a need for more intelligent and flexible transport systems. Urban Air Mobility (UAM) introduces the third dimension to intra-urban transport at a minimal infrastructure cost, bypassing congestion and providing reliable travel times to users through the provision of air passenger transportation. The performance of UAM systems is highly dependent on vertiport locations, vehicle sizing and infrastructure specifications, which themselves are intrinsically linked. This study takes a holistic approach to UAM network optimisation by considering the inter-relatedness of these decisions in a three-stage algorithm. In the first stage, a linear vertiport placement model with vehicle sizing constraints is developed to determine the optimal vertiport configuration while considering eVTOL performance. The vertiport configuration serves to determine the operational requirements of the aircraft and are incorporated in the vehicle sizing models. The resulting network configuration and vehicle sizing constraints are used as inputs in the infrastructure model, which utilises open network theory to determine the service rate requirements and the allowed loiter and waiting times based on the number of take-off, landing, and charging pads at each vertiport. These stages are executed sequentially through a feedback mechanism, which balances the infrastructure, operational costs as well as passenger waiting times. The algorithm optimises the profitability of the UAM network ensuring all operational constraints are satisfied. A case study based on the hypothetical implementation of UAM in the city of London is presented using Rolling Origin and Destination Survey data to estimate demand patterns. Our results suggest that ignoring vehicle sizing and infrastructure modelling in the network optimisation stage results in infeasible UAM networks. Furthermore, reducing waiting times and loiter times are critical to reduce operational costs of the UAM network, with all optimal configurations yielding waiting times below 5% of the total flight time. The proposed method can be used to plan future UAM developments whilst ensuring operational viability.}

The model needs to be based on real data, network, and traffic information and applied to real cities and situations, particularly those with complex public transportation systems. In this paper, we propose a new agent-based model for SAV deployment that enables the parametric assessment of key performance indicators from the perspective of potential SAV users, vehicle manufacturers, operators, and local authorities. This has been applied to a case study of three regions in London: central, inner, and outer. The results show there is no linear correlation between an increased ridesharing acceptance level and average trip duration. Without a fleet rebalancing algorithm, over 80pc of SAV energy expenditure is on picking up customers. By reducing pickup distance, SAVs could be a contender for a nonpersonal transportation system based on trip energy comparisons. The results provide a picture of future SAV systems for potential users and offer suggestions as to how operators can devise an optimal transportation strategy beyond the question of fleet size and how policymakers can improve the overall transport network and reduce its environmental impact based on energy consumption. As a result of its flexibility and parametric capability, the model can be utilized to inform any local authority how SAV services could be deployed in any city. }

  abstract  = {Autonomous Vehicles have the potential to save millions of lives and increase the efficiency of transportation services. However, the successful deployment of AVs requires tackling multiple challenges related to modeling and certifying safety. State-of-the-art decision-making methods usually make use of end-to-end approaches, where raw high-dimensional inputs are passed to learning models with the expectation that the agent learns directly from the data; or imitation learning approaches that use human driving examples for training the AVs. Despite extensive efforts to date by AV developers, these methods still have failure levels that pose significant safety risks, giving rise to the necessity of risk-aware AVs that can better predict and handle dangerous situations. Furthermore, current approaches tend to lack explainability due to their reliance on end-to-end Deep Learning, where significant causal relationships are not guaranteed to be learned from data.
  This paper introduces a novel risk-aware framework for training AV agents using a bespoke collision prediction model and Reinforcement Learning (RL). The collision prediction model is based on Gaussian Processes and vehicle dynamics, and is used to generate the RL state vector. The use of an explicit risk model increases the post-hoc explainability of the AV agent, which is vital for reaching and certifying the high safety levels required for AVs and other safety-sensitive applications. 
  Experimental results using a simulator and state-of-the-art RL algorithms show that risk-awareness can decrease collision rates, and that makes AVs more robust to sudden harsh braking situations. The proposed collision prediction model also outperforms other collision models in the literature. Moreover, the risk-aware RL-based framework achieves better performance in both safety and speed when compared to a standard rule-based method, the  Intelligent Driver Model (IDM).}

abstract = {Mobile parcel lockers (MPLs) have been recently proposed by logistics operators as a technology that could help reduce traffic congestion and operational costs in urban freight distribution. Given their ability to relocate throughout their area of deployment, they hold the potential to improve customer accessibility and convenience. In this study, we formulate the Mobile Parcel Locker Problem (MPLP), a special case of the Location-Routing Problem (LRP) which determines the optimal stopover location for MPLs throughout the day and plans corresponding delivery routes. A Hybrid Q-Learning-Network-based Method (HQM) is developed to resolve the computational complexity of the resulting large problem instances while escaping local optima. In addition, the HQM is integrated with global and local search mechanisms to resolve the dilemma of exploration and exploitation faced by classic reinforcement learning (RL) methods. We examine the performance of HQM under different problem sizes (up to 200 nodes) and benchmarked it against the exact approach and Genetic Algorithm (GA). Our results indicate that HQM achieves better optimisation performance with shorter computation time than the exact approach solved by the Gurobi solver in large problem instances. Additionally, the average reward obtained by HQM is 1.96 times greater than GA’s, which demonstrates that HQM has a better optimisation ability. Further, we identify critical factors that contribute to fleet size requirements, travel distances, and service delays. Our findings outline that the efficiency of MPLs is mainly contingent on the length of time windows and the deployment of MPL stopovers. Finally, we highlight managerial implications based on parametric analysis to provide guidance for logistics operators in the context of efficient last-mile distribution operations.}

The critical challenge of improving mutual understanding between both vehicle types cannot be addressed only by feeding extensive driving data into data-driven models but by enabling autonomous vehicles to understand and apply common driving behaviors analogous to human drivers. Therefore, we designed and conducted two electroencephalography experiments for comparing the cerebral activities of human linguistics and driving understanding. The results showed that driving activates hierarchical neural functions in the auditory cortex, which is analogous to abstraction in linguistic understanding. Subsequently, we proposed a neural-informed, semantics-driven framework to understand common human driving behavior in a brain-inspired manner. This study highlights the pathway of fusing neuroscience into complex human behavior understanding tasks and provides a computational neural model to understand human driving behaviors, which will enable autonomous vehicles to perceive and think like human drivers.}

In light of this disruptive transformation, the Right-Of-Way (ROW) composition of road space has the potential to be renewed. Design approaches and intelligent control models have been proposed to address this problem, but we lack an operational framework that can dynamically generate ROW plans for AVs and pedestrians in response to real-time demand. Based on microscopic traffic simulation, this study explores Reinforcement Learning (RL) methods for evolving ROW compositions. We implement a centralised learning paradigm and a distributive learning paradigm to separately perform the dynamic control on several road network configurations. Experimental results indicate that the algorithms have the potential to improve traffic flow efficiency and allocate more space for pedestrians. Furthermore, the distributive learning algorithm outperforms its centralised counterpart regarding computational cost, benchmark rewards, best cumulative rewards, optimal actions and rate of convergence. This novel road management technique could potentially contribute to the flow-adaptive and active mobility-friendly streets in the AVs era.}

These have been usually modeled by previous studies as a certain class of dynamic vehicle routing problem (DVRP) where goods must be delivered from a depot to a set of customers in the same day that the orders were placed. Adaptive exact solution methods for DVRPs can become intractable even for small problem instances. In this paper, the same-day delivery problem (SDDP) is formulated as a Markov decision process (MDP) and it is solved using a parameter-sharing Deep Q-Network, which corresponds to a decentralised multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) approach. For this, a multi-agent grid-based SDD environment is created, consisting of multiple vehicles, a central depot, and dynamic order generation. In addition, zone-specific order generation and reward probabilities are introduced. The performance of the proposed MARL approach is compared against a mixed-integer programming (MIP) solution. Results show that the proposed MARL framework performs on par with MIP-based policy when the number of orders is relatively low. For problem instances with higher order arrival rates, computational results show that the MARL approach underperforms MIP by up to 30pc. The performance gap between both methods becomes smaller when zone-specific parameters are employed. Execution time results indicate that the MARL approach is, on average, 65 times faster than the MIP-based policy, and therefore may be more advantageous for real-time control, at least for small-sized instances. }

Various methods have been proposed to perform pedestrian crossing intention prediction, among which the skeleton-based methods have been very popular in recent years. However, most existing studies utilize manually designed features to handle skeleton data, limiting the performance of these methods. To solve this issue, we propose to predict pedestrian crossing intention based on spatial-temporal graph convolutional networks using skeleton data (ST CrossingPose). The proposed method can learn both spatial and temporal patterns from skeleton data, thus having a good feature representation ability. Extensive experiments on a public dataset demonstrate that the proposed method achieves very competitive performance in predicting crossing intention while maintaining a fast inference speed. We also analyze the effect of several factors, e.g., size of pedestrians, time to event, and occlusion, on the proposed method.}

However, such a popular street design paradigm also faces endogenous pressures like the appeal to a more balanced ROW for non-vehicular users. In addition, the deployment of Autonomous Vehicle (AV) mobility is likely to challenge the conventional use of the street space as well as this scheme. Previous studies have invented automated control techniques for specific road management issues, such as traffic light control and lane management. Whereas models and algorithms that dynamically calibrate the ROW of road space corresponding to travel demands and place-making requirements still represent a research gap. This study proposes a novel optimal control method that decides the ROW of road space assigned to driveways and sidewalks in real-time. To solve this optimal control task, a reinforcement learning method is introduced that employs a microscopic traffic simulator, namely SUMO, as its environment. The model was trained for 150 episodes using a four-legged intersection and joint AVs-pedestrian travel demands of a day. Results evidenced the effectiveness of the model in both symmetric and asymmetric road settings. After being trained by 150 episodes, our proposed model significantly increased its comprehensive reward of both pedestrians and vehicular traffic efficiency and sidewalk ratio by 10.39%. Decisions on the balanced ROW are optimised as 90.16% of the edges decrease the driveways supply and raise sidewalk shares by approximately 9%. Moreover, during 18.22% of the tested time slots, a lane-width equivalent space is shifted from driveways to sidewalks, minimising the travel costs for both an AV fleet and pedestrians. Our study primarily contributes to the modelling architecture and algorithms concerning centralised and real-time ROW management. Prospective applications out of this method are likely to facilitate AV mobility-oriented road management and pedestrian-friendly street space design in the near future.}

The paper is motivated by the recent advancement of connected and autonomous vehicle (CAV) technology and innovations on smart transportation infrastructure. An eco-driving model aiming at energy consumption reduction is developed and a DWPT system layout suitable for charging eco-driving CAVs at a signalised intersection is proposed. The idea is demonstrated in a simulated environment with different market penetration rate (MPR) of CAVs travelling through a signalized intersection equipped with the proposed DWPT system. The results suggest that as MPR of CAV increases, the energy savings for both CAVs and human-driven vehicles (HVs) will increase significantly. At full MPR of CAVs, the reduction of average energy consumption of all types of vehicles can reach up to 62\%. The average energy transferred and stored per battery electric vehicle can increase by up to 5\% and 10\%, respectively. These promising results indicate that a well-designed DWPT system layout together with the eco-driving behaviour of CAVs can have a positive impact on the urban transportation system in terms of resulting energy consumption and emissions.},

As such, dynamic pricing methods have been used to mediate these demand asymmetries through surge price multipliers, thus incentivising higher driver participation in the market. However, the anticipated commercialisation of autonomous vehicles could transform the current ride-sourcing platforms to fleet operators. The absence of human drivers fosters the need for empty vehicle management to address any vehicle supply deficiencies. Proactive redistribution using integer programming and demand predictive models have been proposed in research to address this problem. A shortcoming of existing models, however, is that they ignore the market structure and underlying customer choice behaviour. As such, current models do not capture the real value of redistribution. To resolve this, we formulate the vehicle redistribution problem as a non-linear minimum cost flow problem which accounts for the relationship of supply and demand of rides, by assuming a customer discrete choice model and a market structure. We demonstrate that this model can have a convex domain, and we introduce an edge splitting algorithm to solve a transformed convex minimum cost flow problem for vehicle redistribution. By testing our model using simulation, we show that our redistribution algorithm can decrease wait times by more than 50%, increase profit up to 10% with less than 20% increase in vehicle mileage. Our findings outline that the value of redistribution is contingent on localised market structure and customer behaviour.}

This work identifies a need to better understand the natural and societal impacts of infrastructure interventions under uncertainty. We argue for a change in current approaches to infrastructure: starting from the natural environment and its resources, encompassing societal use of infrastructure and the supporting infrastructure assets and services. To support such proposed new systems approaches to infrastructure, researchers need to develop novel modelling methods, forms of model integration, and multi-criteria indicators. }

Surge pricing multipliers are commonly used and are applied following demand and estimates of customer and driver trip valuations. Combinatorial double auctions have been identified as a suitable alternative, as they can achieve maximum social welfare in the allocation by relying on customers and drivers stating their valuations. A shortcoming of current models, however, is that they fail to account for the effects of trip detours that take place in shared trips and their impact on the accuracy of pricing estimates. To resolve this, we formulate a new shared-ride assignment and pricing algorithm using combinatorial double auctions. We demonstrate that this model is reduced to a maximum weighted independent set model, which is known to be APX-hard. A fast local search heuristic is also presented, which is capable of producing results that lie within 10% of the exact approach for practical implementations. Our proposed algorithm could be used as a fast and reliable assignment and pricing mechanism of ride-sharing requests to vehicles during peak travel times.}

In previous research, delay factors were predominantly identified through surveys administered to stakeholders in construction projects. Such delay factors are typically considered individually and presented at the same level without explicitly examining their sequence of occurrence and interrelationships. In reality, owing to the complex structure of construction projects and long execution time, non-conformance to schedule occurs by a chain of cascading events. An understanding of these linkages is important not only for minimising the delays, but also for revealing the liability of stakeholders. To explicitly illustrate the cause-effect and logical relationship between delay factors and further identify the primary factors which possess the highest significance toward the overall project schedule delay, the fault tree analysis (FTA) method, a widely implemented approach to root cause problems in safety-critical systems, has been systematically and rigorously executed.}

This paper presents a novel endogenous stochastic vehicle routing problem that coordinates UAV deployments and relief vehicle dispatches to minimise overall mission cost. The algorithm considers uncertain damage levels in a transport network, with UAVs revealing actual damage levels by performing rapid network assessment. Ground vehicles are simultaneously routed based on the information gathered by the UAVs. A greedy extact solution approach and an adapted Genetic Algorithm are used to solve a case study based on the 2010 Haiti earthquake. Both approaches provide significant improvements in vehicle travel time over a deterministic approach reported, and are used to quantify the benefits of UAV-assisted response.}

Their low payload capacity and ability to overcome congested road networks enables them to provide fast delivery services for urgent high-value low-volume cargo. This work investigates the economic viability of integrating UAVs into urban hospital supply chains. In doing so, a strategic model that determines the optimal configuration of supporting infrastructure for urgent UAV delivery between hospitals is proposed. The model incorporates a tailored facility location algorithm that selects an optimal number of hubs given a set of candidates and determines the number of UAVs required to fulfil total demand. The objective is to minimize the total cost of implementation, computed as the sum of generalised, battery, vehicle and hub establishment costs. The model is applied to a case study based on the establishment of a UAV delivery network for deliveries between NHS hospitals in London. A baseline scenario is also developed using current NHS vehicles for delivery. Our results demonstrate that UAV-based delivery provide significant reductions in operational costs compared to the baseline. Furthermore, our analysis indicates the location of hubs is more significant to the solution optimality than any increase in range or payload.}

We introduce a pre-planning model that evaluates evacuation policies, using a low-level dynamic traffic assignment model that captures the effects of congestion, queuing and vehicle spillback. Optimal strategies are determined using derivative-free optimisation algorithms, applied to an evacuation problem based on a benchmark dataset. The effects of varying the number of activated paths and the frequency of departure under different network conditions are observed.

A cell-based map-matching technique is proposed to link vehicle trajectories with road geometries, and to produce network-wide spatio-temporal speed matrices. Data limitations are addressed using the Schatten p-norm matrix completion algorithm, which can minimize speed estimation errors even with high rates of data unavailability. A case study using data from Chengdu, China, demonstrates that the algorithm performs well even in situations involving continuous data loss over a few hours, and consequently, addresses large-scale network-wide traffic state estimation problems with missing data, while at the same time outperforming other data recovery techniques that were used as benchmarks. Our approach can be used to generate congestion maps that can help monitor and visualize traffic dynamics across the network, and therefore form the basis for new traffic management, proactive congestion identification, and congestion mitigation strategies.}

In this paper, we develop an integrated, dynamic modelling and simulation framework that combines network and asset representations of infrastructure systems and models the optimal response to disruptions using a rolling planning horizon. The framework considers dependencies pertaining to failure propagation, system-of-systems architecture and resources required for operating and repairing assets. Stochastic asset failure is captured by a scenario tree generation algorithm whereas the redistribution of network flows and the optimal deployment of repair resources are modelled using a minimum cost flow approach. A case study on London's metro and electric power networks shows how the proposed methodology can be used to assess the resilience of city-scale infrastructure systems to a local flooding incident and estimate the value of the resilience loss triangle for different levels of hazard exposure and repair capabilities.}

Given its focus on logic and structure, the proposed framework has minimal input data requirements and does not rely on the presence of extensive historical disruption data. Numerical implementations are carried in a global-scale liner network where disruptions occur in Europe's main container ports.

The aim of this study is to establish a mathematical model for the optimisation of logistics processes in modular construction covering three tiers of operation: manufacturing, storage and assembly. Previous studies have indicated that construction site delays constitute the largest cause of schedule deviations. Using the model outlined in this paper we seek to determine how factory manufacturing and inventory management should react to variations in the demand on construction sites. A two-stage stochastic programming model is developed to capture all possible demand variations on site. The model is evaluated using a case study from the residential construction sector. The application shows that the model is effective and can serve as decision support to optimise modular construction logistics.}

We provide a categorization of liner network perturbations, differentiating between systemic and external and formulate a container assignment model that minimises routing costs extending previous implementations to allow feasible solutions when routing capacity is reduced below transport demand. We develop a base case network for the Southeast Asia to Europe liner shipping trade and review of accidents related to port disruptions for two scenarios of seismic and political conflict hazards. Numerical results identify alternative routing paths and costs in the aftermath of port disruptions scenarios and suggest higher vulnerability of intra-regional connectivity.}

Instead of having perfect information, the drivers are assumed to form groups, among which travel information is shared and utilized for routing decisions. The formation of groups occurs in the cyber layer according to the notion of percolation, which describes the formation of connected clusters in a random graph. The notion of percolation captures the disaggregated and distributed nature of travel information sharing.

Urban design is moving toward space sharing as a means of increasing the community texture of street surroundings. Its unique features aim to balance priorities and allow cars and pedestrians to coexist harmoniously without the need to dictate behavior. There is, however, a need for a simulation tool to model future shared space schemes and to help judge whether they might represent suitable alternatives to traditional street layouts. This paper builds on the authors' previously published work in which a shared space microscopic mixed traffic model based on the social force model (SFM) was presented, calibrated, and evaluated with data from the shared space link typology of New Road in Brighton, United Kingdom. Here, the goal is to explore the transferability of the authors' model to a similar shared space typology and investigate the effect of flow and ratio of traffic modes. Data recorded from the shared space scheme of Exhibition Road, London, were collected and analyzed. The flow and speed of cars and segregation between pedestrians and cars are greater on Exhibition Road than on New Road. The rule-based SFM for shared space modeling is calibrated and validated with the real data. On the basis of the results, it can be concluded that shared space schemes are context dependent and that factors such as the infrastructural design of the environment and the flow and speed of pedestrians and vehicles affect the willingness to share space.}

  abstract = {As of January 2015, the new maximum limit of fuel sulfur content for ships sailing within emission control areas has been reduced to 0.1%. A critical decision for ship owners in advance of the new limits was the selection of an abatement method that complies with the regulations. Two main options exist: investing in scrubber systems that remove sulfur dioxide emissions from the exhaust and switching to low-sulfur fuel when sailing in regulated waters. The first option would involve significant capital costs, while the latter would lead to operating cost increases because of the higher price of the fuel used. This paper presents a literature review of emissions abatement options and relevant research in the field. A cost-benefit methodology to assess emission reduction investments from ship owners is also presented. A study examined the effects of recent drops in bunker fuel price to the payback period of a potential scrubber investment. The results show that lower prices would significantly delay the payback period of such investments, up to two times in some cases. The case studies present the emissions generation through each option for representative short sea shipping routes. The repercussions of low-sulfur policies on large emission reduction investments including cold ironing are examined, along with implications of slow steaming for their respective payback periods. Recommendations are made for research in anticipation of future regulations and technological improvements.}

  abstract = {Maritime shipping is regarded as the most efficient mode of transport; however, its contribution to climate change through greenhouse gas emissions and the health issues related to shipping activity near residential centers cannot be neglected. In recent years, the efforts of regulators, ship operators, and port authorities have led to actions for ship emissions reduction to improve shipping's environmental performance. This work builds on an activity-based methodology that allows the estimation of emissions and examines environmental effects of slow steaming, fuel regulations, near-port speed-reduction schemes, and cold ironing. Pollutant emissions of carbon dioxide, sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, and black carbon are modeled. A linear programming model minimizes fuel consumption through speed differentiation on a shipping line's routes based on fuel costs and binding regulations in each segment of the journey. Although the examined emissions-reduction actions may have a positive regional environmental effect by cutting emissions, it is possible that additional emissions are generated elsewhere because of increased sailing speeds beyond regulated areas. Trade-offs between pollutants are observed for reduction actions that may have a positive effect on some emission species but at the same time result in additional particulate matter and black carbon emissions. The presented framework allows key actors to conduct comprehensive studies and design improved emissions reduction actions with fewer negative impacts in other areas.}

This article extends existing literature to present a consistent and transferable methodology that examines emissions reduction port policies based on ship-call data. Carbon dioxide (CO2); sulphur dioxide (SO2); nitrogen oxides (NOx); and black carbon (BC) emissions from near-port containership activities are estimated. Two emissions reduction policies are considered for typical container terminals. Participation of all calling vessels with a speed reduction scheme can lead to reductions of 8-20 per cent, 9-40 per cent and 9-17 per cent for CO2, SO2 and NOx, respectively. However, speed reduction policies may increase BC emissions by up to 10 per cent. Provision of Alternative Marine Power (AMP) for all berthing vessels can reduce in-port emissions by 48-70 per cent, 3-60 per cent, 40-60 per cent and 57-70 per cent for CO2, SO2, NOx and BC, respectively. The analysis shows that emissions depend on visiting fleet, berthing durations, baseline operating pattern of calling ships, sulphur reduction policies in force and the emissions intensity of electricity supply. The potential of emissions reduction policies varies considerably across ports making imperative the evaluation and prioritization of such policies based on the unique characteristics of each port and each vessel.}

The objective is to assign containers to routes to minimise container handling costs, container rental and inventory costs. The constraints in the model are extended to include route as well as port capacities. It is shown that the problem remains a linear program. A numerical example is presented to illustrate the properties of the model. The paper concludes by considering the many applications of the proposed maritime container assignment model.}

In this model, containers are carried by shipping lines operating strings (or port rotations) with given service frequencies. An origin-destination matrix of full containers is assigned to these strings to minimize sailing time plus container dwell time at the origin port and any intermediate transhipment ports. This necessitated two significant model extensions. The first involves the repositioning of empty containers so that a net outflow of full containers from any port is balanced by a net inflow of empty containers, and vice versa. As with full containers, empty containers are repositioned to minimize the sum of sailing and dwell time, with a facility to discount the dwell time of empty containers in recognition of the absence of inventory. The second involves the inclusion of an upper limit to the maximum number of container moves per unit time at any port. The dual variable for this constraint provides a shadow price, or surcharge, for loading or unloading a container at a congested port. Insight into the interpretation of the dual variables is given by proposition and proof. Model behaviour is illustrated by a simple numerical example. The paper concludes by considering the next steps toward realising a container assignment model that can, amongst other things, support the assessment of supply chain vulnerability to maritime disruptions.}

  abstract  = {Mobile parcel lockers (MPLs) have been recently proposed by logistics operators as a technology that could help reduce traffic congestion and operational costs in urban freight distribution. Given their ability to relocate throughout their area of deployment, they hold the potential to improve customer accessibility and convenience. In this study, we formulate the Mobile Parcel Locker Problem (MPLP), a special case of the Location-Routing Problem (LRP) which determines the optimal stopover location for MPLs throughout the day and plans corresponding delivery routes. A Hybrid Q-Learning-Network-based Method (HQM) is developed to resolve the computational complexity of the resulting large problem instances while escaping local optima. In addition, the HQM is integrated with global and local search mechanisms to resolve the dilemma of exploration and exploitation faced by classic reinforcement learning (RL) methods. We examine the performance of HQM under different problem sizes (up to 200 nodes) and benchmarked it against the Genetic Algorithm (GA). Our results indicate that the average reward obtained by HQM is 1.96 times greater than GA, which demonstrates that HQM has a better optimisation ability. Finally, we identify critical factors that contribute to fleet size requirements, travel distances, and service delays. Our findings outline that the efficiency of MPLs is mainly contingent on the length of time windows and the deployment of MPL stopovers.}

However, achieving SAE Level 5 (full) autonomy will require overcoming many technical challenges. There is a gap in the literature regarding the measurement of safety for self-driving systems. Measuring safety and risk is paramount for the generation of useful simulation scenarios for training and validation of autonomous systems. The limitation of current approaches is the dependence on near-crash data. Although near-miss data can substantially increase scarce available accident data, the definition of a near-miss or near-crash is arbitrary. A promising alternative is the introduction of the Responsibility-Sensitive Safety (RSS) model by Shalev-Shwartz et al., which defines safe lateral and longitudinal distances that can guarantee impossibility of collision under reasonable assumptions for vehicle dynamics. We present a framework that extends the RSS model for cases when reasonable assumptions or safe distances are violated. The proposed framework introduces risk indices that quantify the likelihood of a collision by using vehicle dynamics and driver's risk aversion. The present study concludes with proposed experiments for tuning the parameters of the formulated risk indices.}

  abstract  = {The last-mile urban freight market is characterised by soaring fragmentation, fierce competition and a super-low profit margin. These conditions make it difficult for operators to succeed commercially and provide level-of-service guarantees. At the same time, uncoordinated vehicle trips result in additional traffic that further exacerbates urban congestion and emissions. Despite increasing pressure from local authorities and regulators, there has been a notable lack of success in resolving these issues. Common barriers to progress include the lack of commercially meaningful incentives for operators alongside a reluctance to share information that is deemed commercially sensitive. Previous research in decentralised collaboration has focused on combinatorial auctions, while large-scale applications are still limited. In this work, we propose an Iterative, Decentralized, and Auction-based Mechanism (IDAM) for the last-mile urban freight collaboration. It is individually rational, budge balanced, non-decreasing and theoretically convergent. Its performance is bounded by quantifying the Price of Anarchy and the Price of Stability of corresponding resource-sharing games. From an optimistic view, IDAM could be as efficient as centralized planning. Conservatively, the worst performance depends on the fleet capacity and order spatial distribution. These bounds provide a reference for the potential benefits of collaboration and shed light on our model's suitability. To tackle the computational complexities, implementation strategies are incorporated for accelerating large-scale applications. The IDAM is validated on several instances and against a benchmark model based on the combinatorial auction. A case study of the Inner London Area, which involves 50 companies and 1000 orders, showed that our model can achieve up to 76\% cost savings. }

  abstract  = { Last-mile logistics operators have recently introduced mobile parcel lockers (MPLs) and autonomous delivery robots (ADRs) to alleviate traffic congestion and operational costs. Their ability to relocate their position during the day has the potential to improve customer accessibility and convenience, allowing customers to collect parcels at their preferred time among one of the multiple locations. Previous research on MPLs and ADRs primarily focuses on operations analysis and microscopic optimisation models (e.g., location-routing planning and task scheduling). A discussion of customer decision behaviour (e.g., service preferences and rationality levels) regarding MPLs and ADRs service selection and their effect on system efficiency has yet to be performed in the context of global information applied to customer decision patterns. Accordingly, this paper proposes a congestion-game model to investigate the performance of delivery systems that utilise MPLs and ADRs while taking into account a variety of operating parameters of the two delivery options (e.g., price, delivery efficiency). Additionally, we discuss how varying levels of customer rationality impact the performance of the system. By exploiting the global information of the delivery system (e.g., average cost estimation), we developed a novel algorithm that improves customer decision-making in service selections and system efficiency.  The results show that customers are more sensitive to higher-cost and capacity-limited services (e.g., ADRs). The self-interested behaviour of customers will compromise the efficiency of the system when the equilibrium is achieved. Finally, the improved algorithm with global information applied increases the system performance by 28% to 68% (depending on customer rationality). }

The model needs to be based on real data, network, and traffic information and applied to real cities and situations, particularly those with complex public transportation systems. In this paper, we propose a new agent-based model for SAV deployment that enables the parametric assessment of key performance indicators from the perspective of potential SAV users, vehicle manufacturers, operators, and local authorities. This has been applied to a case study of three regions in London: central, inner, and outer. The results show there is no linear correlation between an increased ridesharing acceptance level and average trip duration. Without a fleet rebalancing algorithm, over 80pc of SAV energy expenditure is on picking up customers. By reducing pickup distance, SAVs could be a contender for a nonpersonal transportation system based on trip energy comparisons. The results provide a picture of future SAV systems for potential users and offer suggestions as to how operators can devise an optimal transportation strategy beyond the question of fleet size and how policymakers can improve the overall transport network and reduce its environmental impact based on energy consumption. As a result of its flexibility and parametric capability, the model can be utilized to inform any local authority how SAV services could be deployed in any city. }

Achieving effective coordination in multi-agent systems is a difficult task that remains largely unresolved. Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning has arisen as a powerful method to accomplish this task because it considers the interaction between agents and also allows for decentralized training -- which makes it highly scalable. However, transferring policies from simulation to the real world is a big challenge, even for single-agent applications. Multi-agent systems add additional complexities to the Sim-to-Real gap due to agent collaboration and environment synchronization. In this paper, we propose a method to transfer multi-agent autonomous driving policies to the real world. For this, we create a multi-agent environment that imitates the dynamics of the Duckietown multi-robot testbed, and train multi-agent policies using the MAPPO algorithm with different levels of domain randomization. We then transfer the trained policies to the Duckietown testbed and compare the use of the MAPPO algorithm against a traditional rule-based method. We show that the rewards of the transferred policies with MAPPO and domain randomization are, on average, 1.85 times superior to the rule-based method. Moreover, we show that different levels of parameter randomization have a substantial impact on the Sim-to-Real gap.},

  abstract  = {Autonomous vehicles (AVs) have been lauded as the next stage in transportation for decades, although they suffer from several shortcomings, including interactions with pedestrians (Tabone et al. 2021). Previous studies have focused on investigating communication techniques between autonomous vehicles and pedestrians or on the interpretation of pedestrian actions (de Clercq et al. 2019; Stanciu et al. 2018; Habibovic et al. 2018). A recent informative review suggested several priorities for research on AV-pedestrian interactions, including the requirement for universal algorithms and large-scale datasets, covering a range of road types, car designs and pedestrian demographics (Rasouli and Tsotsos 2020). This study contributes to these requirements, by investigating perceived safety and road crossing decisions in response to traditional and autonomous vehicles, at a range of crossing points. Investigating the pedestrian-AV interactions can be difficult, given the relative expense and danger of physical experiments including an unpredictable machine and vulnerable participants. This has led to previous studies on pedestrians and AVs performing stated-preference (SP) approaches, rather than physical experiments, to investigate relevant details surrounding situational outcomes and AV design. There is a wealth of knowledge surrounding the design of SP surveys, however there are questions remaining surrounding the best medium in which to present them, and how much of the relevant information is interpreted by the participant. Visualization techniques such as images and videos are often used as a dense, easily interpretable medium to provide participants with exact replicas of a situation. However, such data is usually presented in 2-dimensional formats (e.g. a computer), which necessarily reduces some of the information available, and can also reduce the level of immersion experienced by the participant. Virtual reality (VR) is an established research tool that provides an immersive environment while allowing user interaction. However, there remain numerous questions surrounding the validity of using VR and the extent of its benefits as a data generating tool (Arellana et al. 2020; Mokas et al. 2021; Rossetti and Hurtubia 2020). As a result of these limitations, it is still unknown how much the level of immersion can influence a participant’s SP responses. This study investigates participant SP responses to scenarios surrounding autonomous vehicles and road-crossing behaviour using both computer screens and VR headsets as experiment paradigm. This will investigate the relationship between perceived safety and road crossing choices as a function of car type (autonomous or traditional vehicles) and of nearby infrastructure (pedestrian crossings, signalised crossing, and basic road crossing). This builds on the previous studies that have performed SP investigations into pedestrian-AV interactions using VR (Farooq, Cherchi, and Sobhani 2018; Nuñez Velasco et al. 2019) but extend it by performing identical experiments on computer screens in addition to within VR headsets. Thus, we will detect any differences in the level of participant immersion, and crucially, any differences in participant responses. In this study, participants were shown a series of 360° videos, filmed from the perspective of a pedestrian walking towards a crossing point on the pavement in London, UK. Within these video clips, there are either traditional cars, or AVs. The AVs are easily identifiable with numerous sensors (e.g. LIDAR) on the roof of the vehicle. The videos stop just as the pedestrian has the option to cross or wait for the vehicle to drive past. The videos show scenarios for zebra crossings, signalised crossings, and simple road crossings, with each scenario being repeated (in identical videos, as far as practicable) for traditional human-driven vehicles and AVs. The participant was then asked to respond to several SP questions, detailing their impressions and their hypothetical responses. Finally, after all six videos had been viewed, the participants were asked to rate their level of immersion, using the IPQ immersion questionnaire. The study is ongoing, but at the moment of writing there have been 150 participants (we will continue to recruit up to 350) for computer screens, 100 (200) participants for VR headsets, of which 80 (180) participants took part in both. These participants were sampled from members of the public and from staff/student populations. The members of the public were recruited using a social media advertising campaign, as well as in-person engagement events run at major institutions around the United Kingdom. The staff/student population were recruited over a month-long period, where they were invited to perform both the VR and the desktop survey. This study will analyse the difference between SP surveys performed on computer screens and within VR environments, using simple difference testing based on the levels of immersion (as measured by the IPQ score), and on the responses. It will then continue to assess any differences in perceived safety based on crossing type, vehicle type and experimental paradigm. Finally, this study produces structural equations relating the choice to cross a road with the perceived safety, participant demographic, crossing type, vehicle type, and further predictors. Provisional data shows being more immersed in VR does not translate into a difference in perceived safety but distinguishes between the respondents' interactions with autonomous vehicles and traditional vehicles.}

  abstract     = {With the uptake of automated transport, espe- cially Pick-Up and Drop-Off (PUDO) operations of Shared Autonomous Vehicles (SAVs), the valet parking of passenger vehicles and delivery vans are envisaged to saturate our future streets. These emerging behaviours would join conventional on- street parking activities in an intensive competition for scarce curb resources. Existing curbside management approaches principally focus on those long-term parking demands, ne- glecting those short-term PUDO or docking events. Feasible solutions that coordinate diverse parking requests given limited curb space are still absent. We propose a Reinforcement Learning (RL) method to dynamically dispatch parking areas to accommodate a hybrid stream of parking behaviours. A partially-learning Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) algorithm is trained to approximate optimum dispatching strategies. Modelling results reveal satisfying convergence guar- antees and robust learning patterns. Namely, the proposed model successfully discriminates parking demands of distinctive sorts and priorities PUDOs and docking requests. Results also identify that when the demand-supply ratio situates at 2:1 to 4:1, the service rate approximates an optimal (83%), and curbside occupancy surges to 80%. This work provides a novel intelligent dispatching model for diverse and fine-grained parking demands. Furthermore, it sheds light on deploying distinctive administrative strategies to the curbside in different contexts.}

This paper addresses this research gap by developing a reinforcement learning path planning approach, coupled with a task assignment model formulated as a mixed-integer programming problem. The performance of task assignment model is evaluated against a dynamic programming method, and a First-In-First-Out heuristic which serves as the baseline. A case study based on the City of London is proposed to demonstrate the applicability of the integrated model. Results demonstrate the effectiveness of the mixed-integer approach in coordinating the UAV fleet compared to the other methods, with the dynamic programming providing higher returns for large fleet sizes.}

  abstract  = {The last-mile delivery market is highly competitive and is saturated with numerous small operators. In this context, the fierce competition between operators, joint with the rapid increase in the demand for home-delivery, resulted in a significant increase in urban freight traffic further worsening congestion and pollution. To tackle these issues, previous research has studied the implementation of collaborative last-mile operations, with organisations sharing resources in the form of inventory space or transportation capacity. However, a common limitation of the proposed models is ignoring time windows and the effects of externalities such as network congestion. In this work, we propose a framework to quantify the efficiency loss in urban last-mile delivery system by comparing the solutions of a fully-decentralised and fully-centralised last-mile delivery problem. In doing so, we develop a Multi-depot Vehicle Routing Problem with Time Windows and Congestible Network that is solved using a bespoke Parallel Hybrid Genetic Algorithm that accounts for the non-linearities arising from modelling endogenous network congestion. The model is evaluated on a case study based on central London to assess the efficiency gaps of realistic last-mile delivery operations. When time window constraints are not included, our results show that the efficiency loss fluctuates the most with a small number of customers, while it stabilises to less than 15% for instances with over 100 customers. However, time windows could significantly exacerbate this issue, resulting in an additional 25% of efficiency loss.}

  abstract  = { Passenger rejection by taxi drivers impacts the travel behaviour in many cities and suburban areas, often leaving those potential customers in non-popular zones stranded without access to taxis. To overcome this problem, many practices have been implemented, such as penalties to drivers, bans, and new pricing strategies. This paper presents a double auction taxi fare scheme, which gives both passengers and taxi drivers to influence the price, coupled with a clustering method to discourage strategic service rejection in the case study of Bangkok Metropolitan Region, Thailand, which has detailed data availability and uneven taxi journey distributions. The double auction mechanism is tailored to 2019 taxi trips, service rejection complaints, and local travel behaviour to boost transportation equity. To benchmark the performance of the new double auction scheme, a bespoke agent-based model of the taxi service in Bangkok Metropolitan Region at different rejection rates of 0%-20% was created. On one hand, the current rejection behaviour was modelled, and on the other, the double auction pricing strategy was applied. The results indicate that the double auction strategy generates a spatially distributed accessibility and leads to a higher taxi assignment success rate by up to 30%. The double auction scheme increases pickups from locations that are 20-40 km from central Bangkok by 10-15%, despite being areas of low profit. Due to the changing taxi travel landscape and longer taxi journeys, the total air pollutant emissions from the taxis increase by 10% while decreasing local emissions within central areas of Bangkok by upto 40%. Using a 5 Baht average surcharge, the total revenue drops by 20%. The results show that an equity-driven pricing strategy as an implementation of transport policy would be beneficial. }

  abstract  = {Same-Day Delivery services are becoming increasingly popular in recent years. These have been usually modelled by previous studies as a certain class of Dynamic Vehicle Routing Problem (DVRP) where goods must be delivered from a depot to a set of customers in the same day that the orders were placed. Adaptive exact solution methods for DVRPs can become intractable even for small problem instances. In this paper, we formulate the SDDP as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) and solve it using a parameter-sharing Deep Q-Network, which corresponds to a decentralised Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) approach. For this, we create a multi-agent grid-based SDD environment, consisting of multiple vehicles, a central depot and dynamic order generation. In addition, we introduce zone-specific order generation and reward probabilities. We compare the performance of our proposed MARL approach against a Mixed Inter Programming (MIP) solution. Results show that our proposed MARL framework performs on par with MIP-based policy when the number of orders is relatively low. For problem instances with higher order arrival rates, computational results show that the MARL approach underperforms the MIP by up to 30%. The performance gap between both methods becomes smaller when zone-specific parameters are employed. The gap is reduced from 30% to 3% for a 5x5 grid scenario with 30 orders. Execution time results indicate that the MARL approach is, on average, 65 times faster than the MIP-based policy, and therefore may be more advantageous for real-time control, at least for small-sized instances.}

  abstract  = {Recent technological advances have only recently made Urban Air Mobility feasible as a realistic alternative to existing transport modes. Despite the growing interest, this disruptive service requires accurate strategic investments to ensure its viability in the short- and long-term. While airports have been identified as potential sites for vertiports, extending operations to the urban rest of the urban landscape is still an active area of research. To date, this problem has been addressed through eVTOL demand modelling and operations separately, with a complete breakdown of costs seldom considered. This research proposes a holistic approach to maximise returns of investment to ensure commercial viability of the UAM network. In doing so, this paper integrates a demand binary logit model and an operations model to solve the hub location problem. A case study based on South East England, which connects the central London and its surrounding cities with the UK's largest airports: Heathrow and Gatwick. Our findings suggest that networks with five vertiports, eVTOL prices 1.7 times that of taxis, 2 minutes waiting time, operated using two-seater short range vehicles would result in maximum returns. Further analysis indicates that the corresponding vertiport placement mainly included low land cost zones close to very high demand zones, and city periphery zones acting as 'park and ride' stations, with their combination resulting in a return of investment three times larger than typical investing indexes.}

The performance of UAM systems are highly dependent on vertiport locations, vehicle sizing and infrastructure specifications. This study takes a holistic approach to UAM network optimisation by considering the inter-relatedness of these decisions. A vertiport placement model with vehicle sizing constraints is developed to determine the optimal vertiport configuration while considering eVTOL performance. The resulting configuration is used to model waiting times depending on infrastructure specifications. These waiting times are incorporated in the vertiport placement and vehicle sizing models. An iterative approach is undertaken to find the network configuration that balances the infrastructure, operational costs as well as passenger waiting times. The purpose of the study is to inform policy-making by proposing a holistic approach to UAM network design.}

This paper proposes an integer programming model to solve the Location Routing Problem for MPLs to determine the optimal configuration and locker routes. In solving this model, a Hybrid Q-Learning algorithm-based Method (HQM) integrated with global and local search mechanisms is developed, the performance of which is examined for different problem sizes and benchmarked with genetic algorithms. Furthermore, we introduced two route adjustment strategies to resolve stochastic events that may cause delays. The results show that HQM achieves 443.41% improvement on average in solution improvement, compared with the 94.91% improvement of heuristic counterparts, suggesting HQM enables a more efficient search for better solutions. Finally, we identify critical factors that contribute to service delays and investigate their effects.}

  abstract  = {Short-term traffic prediction is one of the most important elements in Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS). Although an extensive collection of state-of-the-art methods emerge, the well-established approaches require stringent assumptions that both the training data and testing data must be in the same feature space with independent and identical distribution and sufficient and representative training data, including most features in the feature space. However, due to systematic measurement error, communication problems, and device failure, traffic sensors cannot provide sufficient and erroneous-free data all the time in practice. To address this challenge, this paper proposes a feature-based domain adaptation framework for short-term traffic prediction. This proposed framework can obtain traffic flow feature representations across different domains (i.e., links), where the marginal probability distributions in different domains are close to each other, while the data structural properties in each domain are adequately preserved. With such a mapping, the cross-domain feature set can be created, and any conventional statistical learning methods can be applied to train regression models for the prediction task on the target links. The proposed domain adaptation framework is validated by using traffic flow data collected from Inductive Loop Detectors (ILD) in the UK. The results show that the proposed framework can transfer the features in the source domain to improve the prediction performance in the target prediction task.},

The development of model-based methods is essential for achieving more explainable tools that provide better safety assurances, in contrast to popular data-dependent end-to-end learning methods. This paper introduces a model-based collision prediction method that uses discretized Gaussian processes for future vehicle position estimation. It can incorporate road layout information, statistical agent dynamics, and be coupled with any trajectory prediction module. The discretization of the space together with a single Normal random variable for each vehicle trajectory allows fast and efficient computation for real-time deployment and computational intensive applications, such as simulation and training of Deep Learning and Reinforcement Learning models. The method can be applied to various scenarios by the adjustment of the model parameters that control dynamics uncertainty. Two scenarios extracted from real data are used as case studies.}

However, there is a lack of effective controlling techniques for these adaptive street infrastructures. To fill this gap in existing studies, we formulate this control problem as a Markov Game and develop a solution based on the multi-agent Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (MADDPG) algorithm. The proposed model can dynamically assign ROW for sidewalks, autonomous vehicles (AVs) driving lanes and on-street parking areas in real-time. Integrated with the SUMO traffic simulator, this model was evaluated using the road network of the South Kensington District against three cases of divergent traffic conditions: pedestrian flow rates, AVs traffic flow rates and parking demands. Results reveal that our model can achieve an average reduction of 3.87% and 6.26% in street space assigned for on-street parking and vehicular operations. Combined with space gained by limiting the number of driving lanes, the average proportion of sidewalks to total widths of streets can significantly increase by 10.13%.}

Energy stored, which is defined as the result of energy transferred to the vehicle battery by DWPT system subtracting energy consumed by the vehicle battery whilst travelling the same distance, is used to evaluate the total impact of eco-driving behavior on energy consumption and charging capacity. The simulation results show that at full CAV penetration rate, there are 62% reduction of average energy consumption of all types of vehicles and 10% increase of average energy stored per battery electric vehicle compared to full HVs case.

  abstract  = {This paper presents a novel methodological framework to the definition of vulnerability indices in disaster risk management at container terminals, based on a top-down approach. This proposal is aimed at answering the need for improved consistency in information flows between implementors of risk management processes (e.g., terminal operators, port authorities, port risk committees) and risk analysts. It also answers to the risk assessment and risk management push from the latest risk management ISO 31000:2018 guidance to work toward a more integrated approach with upper level strategies. In order to better correlate the risk indices provided by risk analysts to operational and risk management objectives of risk-bearers, a method relying on a dynamic value-flow stakeholder analysis is carried out for the different phases of the risk management cycle. A methodology is presented in this paper to successively build the stakeholder model, characterise the performance targets and needs of each and hence the value flows that link them together. Once these are qualitatively assessed, a quantitative assessment of the value contribution factors of each stakeholder interdependency within the network is proposed, based on the model of stakeholders' satisfaction following a service-based operational approach. Once those key stakeholders' interdependencies are quantified and the critical stakeholders and links within the networks identified for the benefits of the container terminal operator, corresponding tangible vulnerability indices are defined. A dual approach to vulnerability indices definition is proposed. It consists in an internal operation vulnerability index and external contextual vulnerability indices that account for the environmental vulnerability contribution factors. The identification of the key internal operational vulnerability indices is based on fault tree analyses, whilst the contextual indices utilise the stakeholder model and existing macro socio-economic indices. Such vulnerability indices can then be utilised in natural disaster risk assessment frameworks consistently with key risk management decision making processes and corporate targets. },

  abstract  = {In previous work, the authors pioneered the use of spanning trees to study the optimal structure of public transport networks. Spanning trees have the minimum number of links (one less than the number of nodes) and connect all nodes without loops. The spanning tree that minimises passenger-kilometers indicates where the public transport hubs should be located and which stations should be connected directly to each other. This paper applies the same technique to the world container shipping network to reveal the natural hubs and trade routes. However, finding the spanning tree with least TEU-kilometers poses two computational challenges. The first relates to the availability of demand data. We use a gravity model to estimate TEU flows between ports based on port throughput data and the nautical sailing distances between ports. The second relates to the size of the network. Cayley's formula reveals that for n nodes there are nn-2 distinct spanning trees, rendering finding an exact solution impractical as the number of ports in the database (n) exceeds 460. Two heuristics developed for the earlier public transport work were applied here. The results reveal how the number of hubs in the maritime network depends on the elasticity of demand with respect to sailing distance. Where the elasticity of demand is low, there are few large hubs, while when the elasticity of demand is high, there are many smaller hubs. For elasticities of demand between the extremes, the larger hubs appear in logical locations, like Singapore and Rotterdam.},

This study develops a multi-stage stochastic programming model for identifying the optimal supply chain configuration for the modular construction method. Site demand is considered to be stochastic, forcing the project managers to make several operational decisions at multiple time points during project execution. The developed model can provide the best production, transportation and inventory plans, as well as the most favourable initial inventory preparation schemes.

To address this gap in literature, in this paper we propose a bilevel optimization model for the Charging Facility Placement problem (CFP), implemented from the perspective of TNC operators.},

  abstract  = {Small Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are finding a rapidly increasing number of applications in delivery, passenger transport, surveillance of assets, traffic monitoring and other industries. Apart from regulatory hurdles, low payload and range, a fundamental limitation for their large-scale implementation relate to airspace management. UAV operations are expected to occur in shared airspace with static and dynamic obstacles, including low altitude manned flight and areas of prohibitive weather. Given the large UAV fleet sizes envisioned, it becomes imperative to create airspace management heuristics that provide optimal and non-conflicting flight paths under short runtime. To this effect, we develop a dynamic airspace sectorisation algorithm that discretises the airspace into sectors. The optimal arrangement and size of airspace sectors are determined by the fleet position and direction, and change during the operation time window. A trajectory heuristic is integrated into the sectorisation algorithm that determines non-conflicting optimal paths for every vehicle, conforming to the Performance Based Navigation requirements and considering payload and range variations. The proposed methodology is applied to a UAV relief delivery operation in the aftermath of the Chi-Chi earthquake, in Taiwan. The model is compared with a single sector case and a static airspace case, where sectors are pre-determined based on the warehouse locations. Results show a substantial acceleration in runtime with minimal increase in flight-time and mission time.}

Indeed, a recent study by has presented evidence that such shifts have already occurred and can be directly linked to increased congestion in major cities. Many studies in taxi pricing have adopted an economic theory perspective, using aggregate demand and supply models to represent the dynamics of urban taxi operations. However, the relationship between dynamic TNC pricing strategies and public transport provision remains unexplored to this date. To address this issue, we propose a novel, game-theoretic, dynamic pricing model that accounts for multiple TNCs operating alongside public transport services. This is applied to a city-wide service scenario, and compared to an alternative static pricing model that serves as a baseline. Finally, we perform a comparative analysis of expected utilities for travellers and operators, while monitoring mode share fluctuations across a range of competitive scenarios and market structures.}

Given the desire to reduce operating costs and the emergence of Autonomous Vehicles (AVs), the introduction of TNC-owned AV fleets could convert such services into one-sided markets, where operators have full control of service supply. In this paper we investigate the impact of utility-based dynamic pricing for Autonomous TNCs (ATNCs) in one-sided markets. We test the method using an Agent-Based Model (ABM) of Greater London in conditions of monopoly and competition, focusing on a statically priced ATNC service that offers a mix of private and shared ride services. Public transport is considered as an alternative mode of transportation in both scenarios. Results indicate that in monopoly, dynamic pricing provides higher revenues than static pricing at non-peak hours when average waiting times are low. On the contrary, in competition, dynamic pricing is superior at peak hours where increased waiting times are observed, thus increasing the value of low waiting time rides. Overall, in both market structures, it is found that shared trips are more popular in dynamic pricing compared to static pricing.}

  abstract  = {After natural disasters and other major disruptions, interdependencies between transport networks and other critical infrastructure systems can result in additional vulnerabilities, such as cascading failure, delayed recovery and network congestion. Empirical studies have documented such interdependency effects for various catastrophic events, including the 2001 terror attack in New York City (Lee II, Mitchell, and Wallace 2007), the 2003 electrical blackout in Italy (Buldyrev et al. 2010), various hurricanes in Florida (McDaniels et al. 2007), the 2008 winter storms in China (Rong, Han, and Liu 2010), and the 2010 earthquake in Chile (Dueñas-Osorio and Kwasinski 2012). For the development of strategies to enhance the resilience of urban transport systems, quantitative models are needed that take into account interdependencies and can evaluate the performance of different system configurations in a what-if analysis for various hazard scenarios. Previous studies on this problem have extended classical network flow theory to include interdependency effects (e.g. Lee II, Mitchell, and Wallace 2007; Holden et al. 2013; Fotouhi, Moryadee, and Miller-Hooks 2017). This paper aims to contribute to the further development of this methodology with a dynamic network flow model that captures various types of dependency relations and different degrees of anticipation. The proposed method comprises a stochastic model that generates scenarios for the operability of infrastructure network assets, and a minimum cost flow assignment model for the simulation of dynamic flows in coupled networks. Interdependency effects are taken into account both at the asset operability level and at the network flow level. The flow assignment model can simulate different degrees of anticipation, allowing the model to capture important aspects related to operational decision-making, for example, information sharing between network operators and the use of predictive models to estimate recovery times. A case study on London's metro system demonstrates how the proposed method can be used to quantify the effects of interdependency and anticipation in a flooding scenario.}

This paper presents a novel assessment method that considers interdependencies both at the level of individual infrastructure assets and at the network level. The method uses a stochastic process to simulate the loss and recovery of asset operability taking into account the propagation of failure probabilities and recovery delays due to dependencies on other systems. For the network level, a minimum cost flow assignment model is developed that enables the simulation of coupled flows in interdependent networks. Infrastructure resilience is evaluated as the overall ability of the systems to meet certain demand levels in disruptive event scenarios. A case study analysing the resilience of London's mass transit and electricity networks against flooding demonstrates the key features of the model and how it could be used to devise more effective strategies for the improvement of urban infrastructure resilience.}

The natural disasters considered are earthquakes, storms and tsunamis. The global shipping network is modelled as a top-level network of nodes (terminals, and key logistical and transportation nodes) and links (shipping routes, at sea and inland). Each node's probability of performance loss is assessed based on a combination of fault tree, hazard scenario tree and network flow analyses considering interdependences between physical systems (including infrastructure services networks) and operational systems. The proposed approach relies on an attacker-defender model combined to a cost-based container assignment model to assess routing and disruption costs and allow the identification of optimum alternative routing paths after a disruption. The paper then showcases the application of this methodology to the case study of the shipping routes associated to the KIX Australia-Asia Shipping line. The findings of this study are presented, additionally to disruption costs, as maps showing the probable loss of terminals' performance in terms of container throughput, and in terms of loss of transmissivity capacity for hinterland links. Optimal alternative hinterland links and container terminal rerouting options are also proposed.}

At the same time, it has been demonstrated that in certain cases, such enhancements might prove detrimental to overall performance, or would increase vulnerability to disruptions due to systemic complexity. Asia-to-Europe liner services represent one of the key segments of the international container shipping market. The recently established One-Belt-One-Road (OBOR) policy aims to further enhance the performance of this corridor, with a range of initiatives that notably include a set of overland direct rail service between China and Europe. These can halve the transit times ordinarily required by traditional liner services, and as such have the potential reduce overall shipping costs for certain product classes of despite the increased cost of rail service. With the increasing attention attracted by these initiatives, it is crucial to understand their potential impact to the global container transport network. Furthermore, the effects of long-standing concerns, such as transhipment, trade imbalance, modal integration and resilience should be examined in new light. We address these challenges with a quantitative framework capable of identifying most vulnerable components in large networks with limited or no historical disruption data. We propose a game-theoretic attacker-defender model (ADM) consisting of a two-player, zero-sum game between a global ocean carrier (defender) that aims at minimising container routing costs and malevolent agent (attacker) that aims at maximising disruption costs. A numerical case study for the Asia-to-Europe trade is constructed to assess the impact of the OBOR freight corridor on network resilience. Results identify the most vulnerable network components and interventions that would increase system resilience such as investment on alternative transhipment hubs.}

  abstract  = {In the past ten years, the popularity of car sharing schemes has been growing rapidly. Depending on service policies, a customer might be required to return the vehicle to the same location or a different one. The latter type of service is termed as one-way car sharing since the client is not required to make a return trip to leave the vehicle. It is expected that the car sharing companies will start offering autonomous vehicles in their fleet in the future, in line with the growth of investment in autonomous cars in the automotive industry. Fleet management of autonomous vehicles is, therefore, an area which could be explored to devise and offer solutions to companies regarding autonomous vehicle applications. This paper explores the implementation of an approach with a mixed-integer programming (MIP) algorithm which is inspired by one-way car sharing schemes, to offer assistance on strategic decisions such as fleet size, depot location, and number, as well as depot capacity for shared autonomous vehicle (SAV) systems within cities. The proposed model uses stochastic demand based on expected origin and destination (OD) matrices for a modified version of the Sioux Falls network, incorporates relocations to serve demand and is subject to charging and maintenance constraints. The results show that the proposed model could potentially be used in larger networks, with expected demand of trips to be used as a relocation strategy.},

However, traffic congestions due to the surge in demand and inefficient planning often limits the effectiveness of an evacuation. In this study, it is suggested that scheduling the departure time and assisting the destination and path choice of evacuees could optimise the evacuation process. A real-time decision support and pre-planning model is proposed, and a system-optimal dynamic traffic assignment problem is formulated. A simulation-based metaheuristic is used, consisting of an upper-level that is a genetic algorithm engine which optimises the solution, and a lower-level that is a traffic simulator which evaluates the goodness of the solutions generated by the upper-level. The traffic simulator is a macroscopic dynamic traffic assignment model that captures queuing and congestion. The model is tested on the Sioux-Falls network and an expanded, more realistic version of that network, known as Enriched Sioux-Falls network. The effects of varying the number of paths evacuees are allowed to use and the frequency of decisions made is observed. The proposed model showed that scheduling departure time is an effective method to improve evacuation efficiency when compared to a worst case benchmark scenario.}

The model takes into account different mechanisms of cascading failure, namely failure propagation, delay of recovery and unavailability of production inputs. A numeric example demonstrates how the method can be used to assess and optimises the resilience of a global supply chain against multiple hazards and infrastructure failure.}

The aim of this research is to investigate the factors causing schedule deviation in construction projects and understand the cause-effect relationships between the events leading to delays. Fault tree analysis (FTA) is an established tool to root cause problems. FTA looks deeply into the chain of events leading to a problem to identify its primary cause. FTA was applied to a modular construction project that experienced significant delays. The analysis identified multiple delay factors, and showed how they are linked from the primary causes to the ultimate event.

Changes to the structure of this network, such as increased reliance on hub-and-spoke configurations driven by the introduction of larger container vessels or reduction of buffer times to minimise operational costs stand to alter the ability of the network to withstand disruptions. Such impacts on transport network vulnerability are often paradoxical or not intended. Understanding the extent to which changes in the configurations of liner shipping networks impact transport network vulnerability is of vital importance for public and private decision-makers of the maritime industry responsible for ensuring accessibility to global liner shipping services. This study proposes a game theoretic approach to identify most vulnerable components in liner shipping networks exposed to disruptive events such as loss of functionality in ports due to natural disasters or potential terrorist attacks. We develop a two-player, non-cooperative, zero-sum game between a malevolent agent who tries to maximise disruption costs and a network router who tries to minimise routing costs. A numerical example is presented where, at mixed strategy Nash equilibrium, the most vulnerable nodes and links are identified and the minimum cost routes for given origin destination pairs are found. Results are also used to identify sets of interventions that would increase the robustness of the network.}

On the second level, a network flow analysis is conducted to capture network effects and assess the level of service achieved under various disruptive scenarios. This bi-level modelling approach is applied in a case study on the exposure of London's metro system to flood risk. The results show that the modelling techniques developed in this paper can be used to analyse various phenomena of risk and resilience in complex infrastructure networks.}

Due to its global and near real-time coverage and the inclusion of many news publishers in over 100 languages, it can provide an insight into the frequency and impact of social, economic and political incidents across the world. As an example, it is possible to filter strikes or armed conflicts in different locations, or, to determine the relationships between organisations and people. As the dataset is quite large, big data platforms such as Google BigQuery are ideal to carry out the analysis. BigQuery is an Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) with a familiar SQL-based language for querying the data, allowing for conveniently joining various data sources. We will demonstrate the application of BigQuery on the GDELT data with a few examples, including the measurement of the probability of strikes in international ports.}

Although autonomous vehicles can be powered either by conventional internal combustion or electric engines, the contribution to urban transport sustainability examined in this research concerns the assessment of the potential environmental benefits that might arise from mixed traffic streams (driverless and conventional). The research uses microscopic traffic simulation to assess the performance of mixed traffic streams. The environmental performance of the integrated traffic flow is assessed using instantaneous vehicle emission modelling for different levels of autonomous vehicle market penetration.}

The model is designed as a three-stage complete information game: in the first stage, the firms simultaneously invest in their fleet; in the second stage, they individually design their networks and solve the route assignment problem with respect to the transport demand they expect to serve, given the fleet determined in the first stage; in the final stage, the firms compete in terms of freight rates on each origin-destination movement. The game is solved by backward induction. Numerical solutions are provided to characterize the equilibria of the game.}

This paper uses queuing theory, Petri Networks (PNs) and discrete event simulation to compare the impact on the productivity of yard-side operations in a container terminal of utilising different numbers of Automated Straddle Carriers (AStCs). PNs and discrete event modelling techniques divide complex continuous systems into subsystems and analyse the system as a series of sequential operations being performed on certain entities. Discrete event simulation is used for the utilisation of AStCs with gang and pooling deployment strategies. Venice's new off-shore terminal is used for modelling the complex processes of a container terminal in order to determine the optimal number of AStCs. The equipment sizing results gained from the developed PN and discrete event simulation are closely matching with the optimal solution determined from various models of queuing theory. Given the different effort required for the three methods, it can be concluded that PN represents a fair trade-off and is the methodology of choice for equipment sizing problems, compared to analytic queuing theory and complex discrete event simulations.}

At the same time, these have resulted in significant environmental benefits from emissions reductions, which have contributed to a relative reduction to of the footprint of maritime transport, currently accounting for about 3% of the total world carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. Such initiatives need to be expanded as the maritime transport demand steadily grows and its impacts increase. The maritime transport is also responsible for sulfur, nitrogen and Particulate Matter emissions, which can pose significant threats to public health and resulted in calls from local communities for action. Near port emissions from ships can be classified into three types; those that originate from near-port cruising, manoeuvring and berth emissions. Port authorities tend to develop policies and apply technological solutions to address these types. Slow steaming has been recognised as one of the most promising approaches to reduce cruising emissions. This paper examines the effects of such policies locally and globally, and seeks to answer how to best deploy a vessel speed reduction program for a port authority in order to achieve the highest possible local benefits without compromising on a global level. The economic consequences of adopting such policies are discussed, along with the effects of sulfur emission control areas. The local versus global trade-offs between different pollutants are discussed and the proposed methodology allows the calculation of such trade-offs.}

  abstract  = {Transport operations are significant contributors to pollutant emissions across the globe. Maritime transport is responsible for approximately 3% of the global carbon emissions, while emissions around ports from vessel traffic and stationary ships also affect the local environment. This paper presents a framework for examining these impacts considering the environmental footprint of 1) ships approaching/departing and 2) berthing at ports, where their emissions impact directly on local air quality and on the exposure of the local population. Speed reduction of ships in transit and cold ironing for berthing ships are examined as possible mitigation techniques to illustrate their potential to reduce emissions for a range of different port and vessel types. Their scope is assessed per call per ship for the reduction of emissions for carbon dioxide (CO2), sulfur dioxide (SO2) and nitric oxide and nitrogen dioxide (NOx). Both methods are found to be effective, although the results are strongly dependent on the vessel specification and port operating characteristics. For speed reduction, key factors include the fuel used, the size of the vessel, its operating speed and the speed reduction policy adopted. For cold ironing, the port turnaround time, the source of shore electrical power and policies regarding fuel sulphur content are significant. While the two techniques can be applied independently, one of the two may be preferable in a specific port or for specific vessels. Reductions of 55.1 tonnes of CO2, 267 kg of SO2 and 2046 kg of NOx are seen for the combination of speed reduction for a large ship and prolonged berth duration using a representative shore electrical supply. These results suggest that policies and practices available to shippers can deliver environmental benefits; however, a clear appraisal for costs and benefits of alternatives is essential to inform effective policy development.}

In this model, containers are carried by shipping lines operating strings (or port rotations) with given service frequencies. An origin-destination matrix of full containers is assigned to these strings to minimize sailing time plus container dwell time at the origin port and any intermediate transhipment ports. This necessitated two significant model extensions. The first involves the repositioning of empty containers so that a net outflow of full containers from any port is balanced by a net inflow of empty containers, and vice versa. As with full containers, empty containers are repositioned to minimize the sum of sailing and dwell time, with a facility to discount the dwell time of empty containers in recognition of the absence of inventory. The second involves the inclusion of an upper limit to the maximum number of container moves per unit time at any port. The dual variable for this constraint provides a shadow price, or surcharge, for loading or unloading a container at a congested port. Insight into the interpretation of the dual variables is given by proposition and proof. Model behavior is illustrated by a numerical example applied to the Asia-Europe schedules of a major liner company. The paper concludes by considering the next steps toward realizing a container assignment model that can, amongst other things, support the assessment of supply chain vulnerability to maritime disruptions.}

  abstract  = {Several bike sharing schemes have been deployed around the world over the last decade, with one launching in London over the summer of 2010. A common operational problem with such schemes is the availability of adequate bikes (enough to satisfy demand from users wishing to depart from an area) as well as empty spaces (in order to accommodate demand from users arriving to an area and wishing to part with their bikes). Arrival and departure patterns are found to vary significantly during the course of each day and the week. To meet both types of demand, bike scheme operators commonly deploy teams that work around the clock repositioning bikes among bike stations throughout the city. Using the London bike sharing scheme as a case study and utilising bike availability data collected from the Transport for London website, we seek to establish bike travel patterns. We then proceed with the development of a bike repositioning algorithm that meets both types of demand while seeking to minimise operational cost. The latter is determined by the amount of teams operating at any time, distance travelled and the amount of bikes that need to be moved across the city as part of this process.}

  abstract  = {Container terminal simulation has long been recognised as a powerful tool by researchers and practitioners alike. As automation technologies have evolved past the early-adopter stage and are now considered by an increasing number of port operators, the use of large and detailed simulation models has become the norm in the industry. Their use in the planning stages of a new terminal can assist in streamlining the operation of the port, help identify and resolve potential performance bottlenecks even before the construction of the port has been completed. Due to the complexity and unique nature of the every port, these are commonly purpose-build for specific deployments, and given the amount of detail offered, they are costly to develop and maintain. The paper begins with an overview of past work in the simulation of container ports. These are reviewed and assessed in terms of their applicability for different research contexts. Port emulation, a recent approach that is becoming increasingly popular among industrial circles is also discussed. The paper then proceeds with the discussion of Limen, a novel research-oriented port simulation and assessment tool developed that was developed based on the review.}

  abstract  = {Originating from a freight transportation idea using trailers and attributed to Malcolm McLean, container shipment is probably the biggest development in the field of logistics since the invention of the locomotive two centuries ago. Over the last 50 years, containerization has grown to account nowadays for roughly 70% of total deep sea trade (by value), with annual shipping rates of 143 million TEU (Twenty-foot equivalent units) worldwide in 2008 and an equivalent tonnage of 1.24 billion tons (UNCTAD 2008). Equipment found in container terminals has evolved over the years to enable port operators to keep pace these growing container flows. Space constraints, especially in European ports where land comes at a premium, led to denser stacking and taller, more capable cranes. Operators were quick to adopt latest advances in information technology, which have transformed the way ports operate. Much like their desktop computer counterparts, Terminal Operating Systems (TOS) control port operations, managing the flow of information between different families of equipment and coordinating their operation. In conjunction with advances in logistics and optimisation theory, they have simplified terminal management, boosted terminal efficiency and contributed to the decrease of container dwell times. Conceived as a possibility in the early 1980s and intensively developed ever since, container terminal automation involves remotely operated container handling equipment capable of operating without direct human intervention. After a period of further research and development, more operators gained confidence in the new technology and eventually ventured into their own implementations.

The format for automated container terminal operations is centred on the use of Automated Guided Vehicles for horizontal container movements and Automated Stacking Cranes for vertical movements. To justify the large initial investment required to develop such ports it has to be guaranteed that they will offer a significant operational and performance advantage over alternative setups. With the sheer size and unpredictability of the operations taking place at any time, in order to achieve the needed performance levels movements in the terminal have to be optimally pre‐planned and coordinated, thus resulting to a highly complex optimisation problem. Optimisation methods used in recent automated container terminals operate by decomposing key aspects of the problem into different subproblems, a practice that is known to lead to sub‐optimal solutions in this context. We develop a new control algorithm that jointly optimises most of the problem aspects, based in robust optimisation methods and implement them in prototype terminal control software. Robust optimisation involves the definition of intervals for key parameters, like the start time and duration for individual container movements, and then looks for a solution that minimises maximum regret with respect to particular realisations of parameters. The overall control objective, namely the minimisation of ship loading times, provides the measure of regret. The optimisation takes future events into account through a rolling planning horizon, using intervals to allow for their uncertainty}

In addition to the testing of average of peaked demand conditions, the simulation model has been used to test the early or late running of ferries on port operations, the impact of incidents, technology failure and high security alerts. The adaptive model can use used to optimise ferry timetables, port layout and predict the most effective check in times for freight vehicles. The model has been used to investigate introducing intelligent check-in facilities in the port of Dover, United Kingdom. The port of Dover handles more than 1.8 million passengers and 400,000 cars during the peak tourist month of August. In addition, it caters to more than 1.5 million freight vehicles and has over 14,000 scheduled ferry departures annually. The paper will report on the model's capability to represent current operations of the port and ferry handling facilities, and will present outcomes of a modelled move towards intelligent check-in facilities.}

We implement a robust scheduling algorithm that uses intervals for key parameters and looks for solutions that minimise maximum regret with respect to their particular realisations.}

  abstract  = {Since the events of 11 September 2001, more focus has been given to the role of seaports as critical nodes in the functioning and security of international shipping and logistics, with particular emphasis being placed on container ports and terminals. However, little or no work has addressed the robustness and the reliability of the container port network, be it at the level of terminal operating systems or at the level of international trade and logistics patterns. In this paper, ports and scheduled liner container ship services between West Europe and North America are modelled as the nodes and links of a global network. Following recent work in urban transportation, the properties of the network are examined in the context of complex network theory, with particular reference to error and attack robustness. Generic frameworks and a hypothetical case study are presented to identify points in the network where failure would lead to a wider collapse.}

  abstract  = {Planning of Horizontal Transport is a significant problem with material impact on the development budget and productivity of a container terminal. This paper uses Queuing Theory, Petri Networks (PNs) and Discrete Event Simulation to address the fleet size determination problem for tactical planning. Considering the different information and modelling effort required for the three methods, it is recommended that queuing theory be applied in the preliminary planning stage as it is conservative, while discrete-event simulation which can yield significantly more cost-efficient results is applied for the detailed planning stage. Further development would be still required towards an easily applicable tool based on Petri Nets for practitioners to use in current planning problems, but the methodology itself can provide reasonable yet conservative results at a preliminary planning stage.}

  abstract  = {The environmental impacts of ports have seen increasing attention in recent years, from the academic community, regulatory bodies, and port authorities. The growth of maritime transport has led to the expansion of ports that now need to handle larger vessels—this has a severe impact on local air quality and the marine environment. This article reviews prominent environmental issues that port operations are responsible for and presents the most important regulations, technologies, and initiatives from port associations and authorities that seek to address the issue of pollutant emissions, ballast water treatment, and energy consumption. This article finishes off with suggestions for closer cooperation of regulators and port authorities in developing improved initiatives to reduce the negative effects of port operations.},

  abstract  = {Scale, rather than complexity, is the most visible feature of civil engineering projects. At any time, a global race is underway among cities and countries to become hosts to the tallest skyscraper, the longest bridge, or the largest airport. Record-breaking dimensions are the key feature of how civil engineering projects are usually covered in mainstream media and the biggest attraction for new entrants to the profession. In contemporary cities, however, civil engineers encounter a new family of engineering challenges that are of a different nature to the ones associated with the engagement with a single construction project. As urban agglomerations have reached unprecedented sizes, they have also reached unprecedented levels of complexity. This has sparked a revolution within the civil engineering profession, seeking to find new roles for civil engineers in addressing urban complexity challenges. This chapter initially provides a historical overview of the evolution of civil engineering that has been taking place alongside the constantly evolving nature of urbanization (Section 2). Section 3 describes the role that infrastructure plays in shaping how civil engineering perceives the urban. Finally, key issues that currently affect engineering projects are outlined, as well as the transformations that have been occurring in the civil engineering profession in order to better engage with projects within urban settings (Sections 4 and 5).}

  abstract  = {In recent years slow steaming has resurfaced as a fuel saving measure that allowed ship owners to significantly cut operational costs. Reduced fuel consumption leads to lower levels of greenhouse gases and pollutant emissions. Port authorities have considered offering incentives to ship operators that significantly reduce sailing speed in the port proximity, as a means to improve local air quality. The chapter conducts a literature review on emissions modelling methodologies for maritime transport and develops a framework that allows the estimation of pollutant emissions under different sailing scenarios. The chapter presents existing regulations and port initiatives that aim to reduce maritime emissions. The merits of localised slow steaming near the calling port for various case studies including different ship size, trip distance, sailing speed and fuel policies in place are examined. An activity based methodology is used to estimate fuel consumption and emissions savings during lower sailing speed operation for machinery on-board. Fuel price and the value of time lost govern the extent to which slow steaming and local speed reductions can be effective. The economic and environmental trade-offs occurring at different sailing speeds are discussed from the perspective of both the ship operator and the port authority considering the implications of regulatory policies such as the expansion of Emission Control Areas (ECA). The chapter concludes with a set of guidelines to port authorities on designing attractive speed reduction programmes, and recommendations to shipping companies on improving fuel efficiency across their schedule when such programmes are available.}

Having its roots in the random graph model by Erdo¨s and Ranyi (1959), interest in the field has been sparked by the recent development of the smallworld and scale-free models by Watts and Strogatz (1998). Studies on the subject have shown interesting results in fields as diverse as ecology and social science, possibly the most famous being the discovery that on average only six degrees of separation exist between any two people selected at random. Networks such as the air travel grid, road and subway systems have been analysed this way (Angeloudis and Fisk, 2006; Albert et al., 2002; Dunne et al., 2002), but the technique has yet to find application in other major transportation networks. There has been parallel interest in the application of complex networks theory to supply-chain topologies, regarding such aspects as robustness, resilience and agility}
