# Education

Prof Panagiotis Angeloudis is the course director for the [MSc in Transport and Data Science](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/study/courses/postgraduate-taught/transport-data-science/), offered by the Centre for Transport Engineering & Modelling at Imperial College London. 

We are also offering the following modules: 

{% include section.html %}

## CIVE70111 – Machine Learning
_MSc Engineering & Data Science Cluster (PG), Autumn Term &nbsp; (2024 - Present)_

{% capture text_ML %}

This module offers a comprehensive overview of fundamental machine learning concepts and their application to civil engineering applications. 

It covers the three principal subfields of modern machine learning, ie. supervised, unsupervised and reinforcement learning methids. It also teaches students how to implement ML models using Python and specialised tools such as scikit-learn and PyTorch.
