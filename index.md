The Transport Systems & Logistics Lab (TSL) focuses on the algorithms and models that enable the **design**, **management** and **deployment** of **autonomous transport systems**, in **land**, **air** and **water**. Our emphasis is on  **distributed control**, optimising **freight distribution** and building **resilience against disruptions**.

Led by [**Dr Panagiotis Angeloudis**](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/p.angeloudis), our lab consists of a team of 15 researchers with expertise in **transportation**, **optimisation**, **machine learning** and **robotics**. We maintain strong collaborations with our network of academic collaborators, industrial partners and policymakers.

Our objective is to advance the adoption of automation technologies to increase the efficiency and sustainability of the transportation sector.

Our research focuses on how transportation systems can become more efficient, safe and resilient, focusing on the three interlinked strands of **vehicle autonomy**, **modelling** and **control** for **strategic and tactical decision making**. We use advanced models that incorporate the effects of operational uncertainty (future demand, operational disruptions, targetted attacks) in decision-making. 

Our work on tactical decision-making under uncertainty has sought solutions to these problems through **mathematical optimisation**, **reinforcement learning**, **network modelling**, and bespokely developed high performance **agent based modelling** tools.

Our research team is driven by curiosity and zeal for technical challenges. We benefit from strong connections with other laboratories within the Imperial College community, external collaborators, and industry partners. Our alumni have gone on to achieve success in academia, secure influential roles in industry, or launch their own startups.

**Join us:** We are looking for motivated doctoral candidates to join our team, and contribute to the development of models and enabling technologies for transport systems and freight transport. Several sholarships are available for qualified applicants.
